My name is Austin Hudson. I am a senior(graduating in the fall) at Auburn Unviersity, majoring in Software Engineering. The school is located in Alabama, but I am from North Carolina.

For the last two years I have worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. I help phd students with their papers, mostly either reasearching wiether a given idea is feasable, and if it is creating a simulation and producing data for their ideas. Working as a reasearch assistant  I have also created a small website for the lab (ilab.auburn.edu) and set up the hosting on a machine in the lab. The proffessor that overseas the lab can be reached at weishinn@gmail.com.
